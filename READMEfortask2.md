Task 2

Step 1: Import Libraries
        First, we need to import the necessary libraries.
        
Step 2: Load and Prepare the Data
        For demonstration purposes, let's assume we have a dataset in a CSV file.
        
Step 3: Data Preprocessing
        We need to handle any missing values and prepare the data for clustering.
        
Step 4: Determine the Optimal Number of Clusters
        To determine the optimal number of clusters, we can use the Elbow method.
        
Step 5: Apply K-means Clustering
        Based on the Elbow graph, choose an appropriate number of clusters.
        
Step 6: Visualize the Clusters
        Finally, we can visualize the clusters using a scatter plot.
